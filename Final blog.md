# Modelling of On-Chip Interconnects using Physical Facbrication Parameters
## Abstract

Abstractâ€”This paper looks into the modelling and analysis of
on-chip interconnects in the lower metal region of an Integrated
Circuit (IC). A proposed pi-interconnect model is quantitatively
modelled and analysed and the delay time, td is used as a metric
to measure performance change from ideal circuit simulations
for varying interconnect lengths using a driver-load inverter
pair. The pi-model delay time performance is also compared with
that of a layout of an driver-load inverter pair circuit and a 3-
stage ring-oscillator circuit. The layout is generated using MOSIS
SCMOS technology using ON Semiconductor C5 600nm device
model with VDD = 5V. All modelling and analysis is done using
open-source EDA tools and technology.
