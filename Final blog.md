#### Analysis and Modelling Lower Metal On-Chip Interconnects using Physical Fabrication Parameters

The lower metal layers of the interconnects of the IC was chosen to analyse. A pi-model of RLC network was proposed to model the interconnects, which incorporates
for the fabrication parameters. The pi-model proposed was quantitaively analyzed using the delay time td, which was used as a metric to note the differences in the performances
of the model with the ideal circuit simulations on
* A Driver-Load Inverter pair(CMOS Inverter pair).
* A 3-Stage CMOS Ring OScillator.
The time delay td was plotted for various interconnect lenghts and the accuracy of the model was analyzed.
