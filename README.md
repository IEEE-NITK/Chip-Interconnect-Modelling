# Chip-Interconnect-Modelling

Given set of foundry parameters like on chip microstrip dimensions, substrate permittivity, pitch, material of metal, and type of coupling(inter or intra planer). Project aims to create an analytical model of the interconnect using RLC circuits. The resultant transfer function, Phase plot and delay model can be mapped. This will be compared to an layout microstrip extraction to see how well it matches practical foundry models. Monte Carlo/ VT analysis will also be done for more advanced circuit analysis.
